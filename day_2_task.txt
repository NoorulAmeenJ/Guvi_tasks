Window object [Browser Object Model (BOM)] − It is the outmost element of the object hierarchy.
Inside the object , there will be a document
It displays the contents of the webpage
It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.
We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window
the window object is part of only BOM , and not DOM
 syntax
 window.propertyname
example :
 window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser




Document object[ DOM - Document Object Model ] − Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents of the page.
After loading of the window, a document of html will get ready to loaded
 All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
 We can access the document from a window using the window. document
 The document is a part of both DOM and BOM
  syntax
  document.propertyname
   example 
       document.title :  will return the title of the document
