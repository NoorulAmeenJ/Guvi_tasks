Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
 Hypertext Transfer Protocol
   HTTP1
 It is human readable
 This  is a textual format
 It compresses data by itself
 
 HTTP2
 It is not human readable, becauseit wraps the HTTP
 There is a binary framing Layer

 HTTP2 Is Faster Than HTTP1.1
 HTTP2 is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking


Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
  example 
   var resume = {
    name : "noorul",
    profession : "  IT",
   }

it is  a key: value pair
console.log(resume.name))  it will give noorul

Javascript Object Notation (JSON)
 for this, the key also should be in "" 

 In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object

Booleans , it will zero or one , true or false
Numbers can be objects it will return 1,2,3,4,
Strings can be objects , it will be in double quotes r single quotes , like 'arun' , 'noorul'
Arrays are always objects , it will be like [], what ever inside this symbol, will be in double r single quotes 
Functions  objects , it will be () , arrow functions =>
Objects are always objects  , it will be like { key : value pair }
